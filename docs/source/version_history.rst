Origins
=======

**django-twined** is the result of a refactor - Octue is progressively open-sourcing our stack for managing and
connecting digital twins and data services.

As you do when you're a bootstrapped startup, we build our MVP as a massive monolithic django app, but wanted to reuse
parts of it in applications for clients. Copying/pasting code never makes sense, so here we are!

A huge thank you to `Wind Pioneers <https://www.wind-pioneers.com/>`_ whose business made the initial refactor possible,
and who now get to use twined to build the most kick-ass Wind Energy Resource Assessment applications in the world!

..ATTENTION::

   **django-twined** will be unstable in 0.x versions. Consider every semiver increment to be breaking!

.. _releases:

Releases
========

We create release notes automatically using
our `conventional commits tools <https://github/octue/conventional-commits>`_
for completely automating code versions, release numbering and release history.

So for a full version history, check our `releases page <https://github/octue/django-twined/releases>`_.
