Origins
=======

**django-twined** is the result of a refactor - Octue is progressively open-sourcing our stack for managing and
connecting digital twins and data services.

As you do when you're a bootstrapped startup, we build our MVP as a massive monolithic django app, but wanted to reuse
parts of it in applications for clients. Copying/pasting code never makes sense, so here we are!

A huge thank you to :ref:`Wind Pioneers<https://www.wind-pioneers.com/>`_ whose business made this refactor possible,
and who now get to use twined to build the most kick-ass Wind Energy Resource Assessment applications in the world!

..ATTENTION::

   **django-twined** will be completely unstable in 0.0.x versions. Consider every version to be breaking!
